# Planar data classification with one hidden layer

- Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer
- Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh 
- Compute the cross entropy loss 
- Implement forward and backward propagation

## Dataset ##
 the dataset a "flower" 2-class dataset into variables `X` and `Y`.
- a numpy-array (matrix) X that contains your features (x1, x2)
- a numpy-array (vector) Y that contains your labels (red:0, blue:1).
